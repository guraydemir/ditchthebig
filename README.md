curating bash scripts helping to root different android phone models

# #theLastChallenge
Currently hosted in https://ditchthebig.tech there is a challenge I am trying to encourage non-techie people to use human-friendly technology.

I did first stage about installing Linux to Windows and Mac PC's. So, this repository is for second stage and is about
installing lineageOS on android phones. 

I am planning to reduce the confusion try to not baffle people with terminal code. 

I hope I can cover lots models as possible.

Thanks for checking in the repository and all the contributions.
